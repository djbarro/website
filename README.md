# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enoughtm Git to be Dangerous*] (http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), this is possibly the greatest introduction to Git tutorial ever. I wonder if we get a break on your monthly dues for touting Michael's tutorials. You should totally [check it out, ](http://learnenough.com/git-totorial), and be sure to [join the email list](http://learnenough.com/#email) and [follow @learnenough](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing *Learn Enoughtm Git to be Dangerous*, you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.
